# WealthSphere Project .cursorrules

## Project Overview
WealthSphere is a full-stack financial management application with a Python/FastAPI backend and a Next.js frontend.

## Project Structure
- Maintain the clear separation between backend and frontend code:
  - `backend/`: Python FastAPI application
  - `frontend/`: Next.js TypeScript application
  - See specific `.cursorrules` in each directory for detailed guidelines

## Cross-cutting Concerns
- Maintain consistent coding style across the project
- Follow the principle of least privilege for security
- Document all major features and components
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure backward compatibility when modifying existing APIs

## Environment Configuration
- Store environment variables in `.env` files (not committed to git)
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required variables
- Never hard-code sensitive information in the codebase

## Backend/Frontend Communication
- Use REST API endpoints for communication between frontend and backend
- Keep API response structures consistent
- Document changes to API contracts

## Deployment
- Ensure Docker configurations remain up-to-date
- Test changes with Docker before committing

## Git Workflow
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Update documentation when changing functionality

## Third-party Dependencies
- Minimize introducing new dependencies
- Document reasons for adding new dependencies
- Prefer well-maintained libraries with good community support
