Technical Specification: Scenario Module UI

Feature Overview

This document outlines the UI implementation details for the Scenario Module in WealthSphere. The goal is to provide users with an interface to create, edit, and manage scenarios efficiently. The API is already implemented, so this specification focuses only on the UI.

Feature 1: Scenario Management Page

Objective:

Provide a centralized UI where users can view, create, edit, and delete financial scenarios.

UI Components:

Scenario List View:

Displays all user-created scenarios.

Columns: Scenario Name, Description, Created Date.

Actions: Edit, Delete, Create New Scenario.

The "Actual" scenario is displayed but cannot be edited or deleted.

Scenario Form (Create/Edit):

Fields:

Scenario Name (Required, unique)

Description (Optional)

Actions:

Save (Creates or updates scenario)

Cancel (Discards changes and returns to list)

Validation:

Name must be unique.

Prevent empty submissions.

Prevent modification of the "Actual" scenario.

Delete Confirmation Dialog:

Appears when deleting a scenario.

Users must confirm before proceeding.

The "Actual" scenario cannot be deleted.

UI Design Considerations:

Clean and simple layout with a focus on usability.

Use a modal or inline form for creating/editing scenarios.

Display success/error messages when actions are performed.
