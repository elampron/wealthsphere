Scenario Module Implementation – Technical Specification
Feature Overview:
This feature introduces the Scenario Module in WealthSphere. The goal is to allow users to create, manage, and apply different financial scenarios when making projections. This lays the foundation for future enhancements, including the transition to the Entity Value Table for storing financial values.

Feature 1: Scenario Table & Data Structure
Objective:
Create a new database table to store financial scenarios. This table will serve as a reference for all scenario-related entries.

Key Details:

Each scenario will have a name, description, creation date, and user ownership.
A default scenario called “Actual” will be created in the system automatically.
The “Actual” scenario cannot be deleted or renamed but can be referenced like any other scenario.
Users will be able to create additional scenarios to simulate different financial projections, such as “Early Retirement” or “Market Crash”.
Feature 2: Scenario Management UI
Objective:
Provide users with an interface to create, edit, and delete scenarios easily.

How It Will Work:

A Scenario List View will display all scenarios a user has created.
Each scenario will show its name, description, and creation date.
Users will have action buttons to edit, delete, and select a scenario.
A Scenario Form will allow users to enter a scenario name and description.
Validation will prevent users from creating duplicate scenario names.
The system will prevent users from deleting the “Actual” scenario to ensure data integrity.
Additional Safeguards:

If a user tries to delete a scenario, a confirmation prompt will appear to prevent accidental deletion.
Feature 3: Scenario Selection & Application
Objective:
Enable users to apply a specific scenario when viewing financial projections.

How It Will Work:

A scenario dropdown will be available in the financial projections view.
Users will be able to switch between scenarios to compare different financial outcomes.
The system will remember the selected scenario even after logging out and logging back in.
Database Impact:

When the Entity Value Table is introduced, all financial values—such as investments, expenses, and assets—will reference a scenario ID.
This means users will be able to store different values for the same entity under different scenarios.
