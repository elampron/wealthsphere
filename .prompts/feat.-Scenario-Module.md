Technical Specification: Scenario Module Implementation

Feature Overview:This document outlines the implementation of the Scenario Module in WealthSphere. The Scenario Module allows users to create, manage, and use different financial scenarios for projections and planning. This feature is foundational for future enhancements, including the upcoming Entity Value Table changes. However, scenario-based projections will not be implemented at this stage.

Feature 1: Scenario Table & Data Structure

Objective:Create a dedicated database table to store financial scenario metadata. This table will serve as a reference for all scenario-related entries.

Key Requirements:

The system will have a new table to store scenarios, each having a unique name, description, creation timestamp, and user ownership.

A default scenario named "Actual" will be pre-created in the system.

The "Actual" scenario cannot be deleted or renamed, but it can be referenced like any other scenario.

Users will be able to create new scenarios for alternative financial projections.

Feature 2: Scenario Management UI

Objective:Enable users to create, edit, and delete scenarios via an intuitive interface.

User Interface Requirements:

A Scenario List View that displays all scenarios a user has created, including their names, descriptions, and creation dates.

Action buttons for editing, deleting, and selecting a scenario.

A Scenario Form that allows users to enter a scenario name and description, with validation to prevent duplicate names.

A restriction where users cannot delete locked scenarios, like the default "Actual" scenario.

A confirmation prompt before deleting any user-created scenario.

API Endpoints:

There will be APIs to retrieve, create, edit, and delete scenarios.

Deferred: Scenario Selection & Projections Integration

Reason for Deferral:

Scenario-based projections will only be implemented after the Entity Value Table is in place.

No changes to the current projection system will be made at this stage.

Scenarios will be captured and stored, but they will not yet be applied in financial projections.
